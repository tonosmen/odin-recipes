<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These overnight oats are creamy, full of coconut flavor, and high in protein. Great either cold or warmed and sure to keep you feeling full until way after lunch. I find that the protein powder sweetens the oats enough but feel free to add your choice of sweetener if needed. I top my oats just before serving with additional toasted coconut.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup coconut milk beverage (such as Silk®)</li>
    <li>1 (5.3 ounce) container toasted coconut Greek yogurt (such as Light & Fit®)    </li>
    <li>¾ cup oats</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sweetened flaked coconut</li>
    <li>1 scoop vanilla protein powder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix coconut milk beverage, Greek yogurt, oats, coconut, and protein powder in a bowl until well combined. Divide mixture between 2 Mason jars. </li>
    <li>Refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight.</li>
    <li>Enjoy next day.</li>
